### Want to contribute?

Original source files are all included in `/source` if you want to fork and create more icons. Just use the socialicious-template.ai file and generate an SVG into the `/svg` directory.

### More about this library

This icon set was designed and created by [Shali Nguyen](http://twitter.com/shalinguyen) adapting available vectors from each organization or drawn if vectors did not exist. They were then formatted to SVGs and then generated by [Fontastic](http://fontastic.me/) to create the web font formats. It was inspired by and can be used to extend [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io).
